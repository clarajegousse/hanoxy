Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 31 of /Users/jegoussc/Repositories/hanoxy/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/test/ERR3589576_2.fastq.gz completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
